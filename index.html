                JOSE RIZAL, the national hero of the Philippines and pride of the
                Malayan race, was born on June 19, 1861, in the town of Calamba,
                Laguna. He was the seventh child in a family of 11 children (2 boys
                and 9 girls). Both his parents were educated and belonged to
                distinguished families.

                He was an expert swordsman and a good shot. In the hope of securing political and social reforms for his country and at the same time educate his countrymen,
                Rizal, the greatest apostle of Filipino nationalism, published, while in Europe, several works with highly nationalistic and revolutionary tendencies.
                In March 1887, his daring book, NOLI ME TANGERE, a satirical novel exposing the arrogance and despotism of the Spanish clergy, was published in Berlin;
                in 1890 he reprinted in Paris, Morga's SUCCESSOS DE LAS ISLAS FILIPINAS with his annotations to prove that the Filipinos had a civilization worthy to be proud of even long before the Spaniards set foot on Philippine soil;
                on September 18, 1891, EL FILIBUSTERISMO, his second novel and a sequel to the NOLI and more revolutionary and tragic than the latter, was printed in Ghent
